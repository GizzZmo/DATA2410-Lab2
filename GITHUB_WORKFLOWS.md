## Introduction to GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. Workflows are automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.

### Key Concepts

- **Workflow**: An automated process defined by a YAML file in `.github/workflows/`
- **Event**: A specific activity that triggers a workflow (e.g., push, pull request, issue creation)
- **Job**: A set of steps that execute on the same runner
- **Step**: An individual task that can run commands or actions
- **Action**: A reusable unit of code that can be shared across workflows
- **Runner**: A server that runs your workflows (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted)

---

## Repository Workflow System

This repository uses GitHub Actions for automation tasks. Currently, the following workflows are configured:

### Active Workflows

#### 1. Copilot Coding Agent
- **Purpose**: Automates code assistance and development tasks using GitHub Copilot
- **Trigger**: Dynamically triggered based on repository events
- **Location**: `dynamic/copilot-swe-agent/copilot`
- **State**: Active
- **Features**:
  - Automated code review and suggestions
  - Issue tracking and resolution assistance
  - Pull request analysis and recommendations

---

## Workflow Structure

A typical GitHub Actions workflow file has the following structure:

```yaml
name: Workflow Name

# Events that trigger the workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# Jobs to run
jobs:
  job-name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        python -m pytest
```

### Workflow Components Explained

1. **name**: Human-readable name for the workflow
2. **on**: Events that trigger the workflow
3. **jobs**: One or more jobs to execute
4. **runs-on**: The type of runner to use
5. **steps**: Sequential tasks to perform
6. **uses**: Pre-built actions from the marketplace
7. **run**: Shell commands to execute

## Setting Up Workflows

### Creating a New Workflow

1. Create the workflows directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. Create a workflow file (e.g., `ci.yml`):
   ```bash
   touch .github/workflows/ci.yml
   ```

3. Define your workflow in YAML format

4. Commit and push to trigger the workflow:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
   git commit -m "Add CI workflow"
   git push
   ```

### Workflow Triggers

Common trigger events:

- `push`: When code is pushed to specified branches
- `pull_request`: When a PR is opened, updated, or synchronized
- `schedule`: Run on a cron schedule
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual trigger from GitHub UI
- `issue_comment`: When someone comments on an issue
- `release`: When a release is published

Example:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    types: [ opened, synchronize, reopened ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual trigger
```

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Python CI/CD Workflow

```yaml
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11']
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install flake8 pytest pytest-cov
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
    
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        # Stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
        # Exit-zero treats all errors as warnings
        flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
    
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest --cov=. --cov-report=xml
    
    - name: Upload coverage reports
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml
```

### Automated Testing Workflow

```yaml
name: Run Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
    
    - name: Install linters
      run: |
        pip install flake8 pylint black isort
    
    - name: Check code formatting with Black
      run: |
        black --check .
    
    - name: Check import sorting with isort
      run: |
        isort --check-only .
    
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        flake8 . --max-line-length=120
    
    - name: Lint with pylint
      run: |
        pylint **/*.py
```

### Security Scanning Workflow

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      with:
        scan-type: 'fs'
        scan-ref: '.'
        format: 'sarif'
        output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
    
    - name: Upload Trivy results to GitHub Security
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
      with:
        sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Workflow Not Triggering

**Problem**: Workflow doesn't run when expected

**Solutions**:
- Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Check the trigger events match your actions (e.g., correct branch names)
- Ensure the YAML syntax is correct (use a YAML validator)
- Check if the workflow is enabled in repository settings

#### Permission Errors

**Problem**: `Error: Permission denied` or access issues

**Solutions**:
- Add appropriate permissions to the workflow:
  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: read
    pull-requests: write
  ```
- Check repository settings for Actions permissions
- Verify GITHUB_TOKEN has necessary scopes

#### Job Failures

**Problem**: Jobs fail unexpectedly

**Solutions**:
- Review the workflow logs in the Actions tab
- Check for missing dependencies or environment issues
- Verify runner compatibility (OS, architecture)
- Add debugging steps:
  ```yaml
  - name: Debug
    run: |
      echo "Runner OS: ${{ runner.os }}"
      echo "GitHub ref: ${{ github.ref }}"
      env
  ```

#### Timeout Issues

**Problem**: Workflow times out

**Solutions**:
- Increase the timeout:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    job-name:
      timeout-minutes: 30
  ```
- Optimize slow steps
- Use caching for dependencies:
  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/cache@v4
    with:
      path: ~/.cache/pip
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
  ```

### Viewing Workflow Logs

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on the workflow run you want to inspect
3. Click on the job name to see detailed logs
4. Expand individual steps to see command output

### Testing Workflows Locally

Use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test workflows locally:

```bash
# Install act
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Run workflow
act push

# Run specific job
act -j test

# Use specific event
act pull_request
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Secrets for Sensitive Data

Never hardcode secrets in workflows. Use GitHub Secrets instead:

```yaml
- name: Deploy
  env:
    API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
  run: |
    deploy.sh
```

Add secrets in: Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

### 2. Pin Action Versions

Use specific versions or commit SHAs for security:

```yaml
# Good - pinned to specific version
- uses: actions/checkout@v4

# Better - pinned to specific commit
- uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11

# Avoid - uses latest, may break
- uses: actions/checkout@main
```

### 3. Use Matrix Strategies for Testing

Test across multiple versions efficiently:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11']
```

### 4. Cache Dependencies

Speed up workflows by caching dependencies:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
```

### 5. Fail Fast When Appropriate

Stop matrix jobs early on failure:

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: true
  matrix:
    python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11']
```

### 6. Use Concurrency Control

Prevent multiple workflow runs from conflicting:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

### 7. Add Status Badges

Show workflow status in your README:

```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/username/repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
```

### 8. Document Your Workflows

Add comments to explain complex logic:

```yaml
# This step builds the Docker image and tags it with the commit SHA
- name: Build Docker image
  run: |
    docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .
```

### 9. Use Conditional Execution

Run steps only when needed:

```yaml
- name: Deploy to production
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: |
    ./deploy.sh production
```

### 10. Monitor Workflow Usage

- Check Actions usage in repository Insights
- Set up alerts for workflow failures
- Review workflow logs regularly
- Optimize long-running workflows
